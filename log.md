# 100 Days Of Code - Log
I'll be adding my day to day log here mainly because I don't really use Twitter that much ðŸ˜… but will keep this file updated as much as possible 

## Day 1: January 19, 2022

### ðŸ“… Today's Progress:
Starting with a new project, a small crypto viewer to continue working with react and starting to work with GraphQL and Tailwind CSS ðŸ˜Ž.
Finally got approval for my first Chrome extension B) link in my Git Bio.

### ðŸ¤” Thoughts:
I've tried 100DaysOfCode Challenge a couple of times before without much success but this particular time after 2 years in a pandemic I guess it is worth giving it a try again, Let's do this and see how it goes :)
