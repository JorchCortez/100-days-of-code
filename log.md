# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Worked with my website's blog markdown, added the markdown to show bold text.
2. Created my last project to get the Responsive Web Design certification from Free code camp.

**Thoughts:** I've worked with HTML and CSS for quite a while now, even though I usually searched for the way to do things, how to fully center an object, create gradients, even using the media querys used to be a common search, but during the projects for this certificate I noticed i didn't opened a single site on how to do this or that, I just created the code on my own, man that makes me see my progress and now i just feel amazing on how much i learned during the past weeks that i was going through the course.

### Day 2: June 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Almost finished the first module of the [FCC](https://freecodecamp.org)'s JS certification, just a couple more exercices, boy it's been fun to make all of this

**Thoughts:** Not a lot of things I didn't already knew about before but I did got some cool tips that I don't use quite so often since... well I kinda forget about them, it was great to work on this again.



### Day 3: June 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I had an amazing progress on [FCC](https://freecodecamp.org)'s JS certification, managed to finish 3 full modules and feeling really great about it!
2. Made some refactoring at work and managed to optimize loadtimes on a service that I consume.

**Thoughts:** I think I will be finishing FCC's cert soon it is being real fun to take all the challenges, also came back and made a quick challenge on Codefights but nothing really new over there, I guess i'll keep working on optimizations at the office I know I can get some better code.


### Day 4: June 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Made a couple of challenges on Codefights.
2. Started making an Itch.io section on my website to showcase the games I've made, had some CORS issues though, I hope i can get it working by the end of the month.

**Thoughts:** I still have quite a lot to learn about CORS in general, I usually end up with this kind of errors so I'm gonna go spend some time on the Docs site and make some tests in order to learn how to avoid this kind of issues.



### Day 5: June 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Joined the Weekly Game Jam to practice c# a little bit.


**Thoughts:** Hope I do have enough time to finish a game since I will be a little over worked at the office and I'm also doing the FCC course, we'll see how it goes.




### Day 6: June 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Had some personal stuff so I wasn't able to code, I practiced a little of Pyton on Enki app but I don't think this counts a lot.


**Thoughts:** -----------------.



### Day 7: June 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Worked on a bunch of challenges of the FCC's Javascript certification's Basic algorithm section 


**Thoughts:** Hope I do have enough time to finish a game since I will be a little over worked at the office and I'm also doing the FCC course, we'll see how it goes.



### Day 8: June 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Finally finished the Basic Algorithms module of FCC's Js certification, moving into the Object Oriented Module.


**Thoughts:** Hope I do have enough time to finish a game since I will be a little over worked at the office and I'm also doing the FCC course, we'll see how it goes.
