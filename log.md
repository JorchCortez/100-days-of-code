# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sept 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I finished the 2nd module of the [react native practical guide](https://www.udemy.com/react-native-the-practical-guide) on Udemy, and started a couple of DB models for an app I'm building.

**Thoughts:** I've tried my 100DaysOfCode Challenge twice already and I'm a little frustrated bc I've been unable to made it through the first month, that's why I've started again, I really want to build a habit out of coding specially since it is one of my hobbies but lately I've been working like a maniac at the office and I really want to take a chance now that I've handled the project I was working on, so atm I'm really motivated so let's see how far can we go!.

1. Updated GOESA's website, a project I've been doing for a familly business, still not a lot into the website but i feel like the design it's looking nice so I'm going to keep modifying it until it gives it's best.

**Thoughts:** Well at least I've made it to day 2 so far so it means I'm having a nice start, I'm experinmenting with new css properties I didn't used before so I'm really having a blast learning how to use them, I'ts been a good time learning new things :D!
