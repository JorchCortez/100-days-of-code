# 100 Days Of Code - Log
I'll be adding my day to day log here mainly because I don't really use Twitter that much ðŸ˜… but will keep this file updated as much as possible 

## Day 1: January 19, 2022

### ðŸ“… Today's Progress:
Starting with a new project, a small crypto viewer to continue working with react and starting to work with GraphQL and Tailwind CSS ðŸ˜Ž.
Finally got approval for my first Chrome extension B) link in my Git Bio.

### ðŸ¤” Thoughts:
I've tried 100DaysOfCode Challenge a couple of times before without much success but this particular time after 2 years in a pandemic I guess it is worth giving it a try again, Let's do this and see how it goes :)

## Day 2: January 20, 2022

### ðŸ“… Today's Progress:
Didn't really did much today I was mainly trying to fix some things with an old project (as usual had some dependencies which were already outdated and everything is breaking (: )

### ðŸ¤” Thoughts:
I will start with a couple of new apps one of them being a new project I decided to create and I'm feeling quite happy about it :)

## Day 3: January 21, 2022

### ðŸ“… Today's Progress:
Just as I said yesterday today I started with one of the projects (though the start has only been the "create the project setup" ) I will be working on the design along with a quick refresher for React since it's been about 6 months since I used it for the last time and I want to get proficient with hooks :3 but that'll be something I'll be doing along

### ðŸ¤” Thoughts:
I believe with this project I might take most of the 100 days of code since it seems a bit big but I guess we'll see ðŸ˜Ž
