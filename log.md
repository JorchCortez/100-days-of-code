# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Worked on a couple of excercises on Free code camp's Front End Libraries Certification.
2. Started a landing site for a small job I have.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since last time I used bootstrap and to be honest I thought I have forgotten most of it but during the exercises I did I noteced that I still remember quite a lot about it, I also remembered why I started creating my own css for my sites, not that I dislike bootstrap but i guess everything seemed like anything else on the internet so I'm building the css of the project I'm working on from scratch and see how it goes.

### Day 2: July 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I keept working on my Free code camp's Front End Libraries Certification, currently on the jQuery section, I wan't to start with the react section so bad!
2. I will keep some progress on the landing I've started yesterday, even though I haven't done anything today.

**Thoughts:** After finishing the bootstrap module I was so nostalgic, bootstrap was one of the first frameworks I've worked with and using it again after around 2 years has been nice, there's a lot of new things going on, might give it a try on the folowing days but I do feel really comfortable writting my own CSS code now a days. Working with some jQuery now and even when I use it on my daily bases I know I still have much to learn.

### Day 3: July 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Worked today with the SASS module on Free code camp's Front End Libraries Certification, just finished it and started right away with the react module, I'm just a few exercises into it but I'm having lots of fun, also the SASS module was cool as well, I guess I'll go for Javascript30 as soon as I finish this cert. let's see how it goes.
2. The landing, I'm actually working on some ideas for the about section, (Link below)

**Thoughts:** For the past 2 or 3 years I've been using SCSS on my web apps, I'm still figuring out what I can use all the diferent functions on SASS for but i guess I'll do a project one of this days in order to play around with them.

### Day 4: July 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Worked today with the react module of Free code camp's Front End Libraries Certification, only did a couple execises but it was fun

**Thoughts:** I have made a couple of web apps on react and I do feel confortable working with it but I can notice there is way more things and I want to learn it all!

### Day 5: July 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I wanted to keep up with Free code camp's Front End Libraries Certification but i had just a lot of things to do at work, I ended up fixing some code I wrote way back at the begining of the project somewhere around 2 years ago so I do feel great about it.

**Thoughts:** After 4 years of working with native Android development and 2 years with my current project I feel nice to see how much I've grown on my coding skills, I guess I might look for a koltin course since I have this feeling koltin will replace java eventually, but we'll see.

### Day 6: July 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I continued with my Free code camp's Front End Libraries Certification's react module and did a couple of exercises.
2. Took pen and paper and worked on some simple design ideas for a website Im working on, might post some images of the pens tomorrow as I make them.


**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I took pen and paper to actually draw a layaut, im not really used to it but i guess ill do it more often, i felt great the fact that I could literally draw what ever came to my mind.

### Day 7: July 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Today was mainly a family day so I took most of the day off, even though I got to make some quick exercises on Enki app, anyone who likes code and want to get quick tips and tricks as well as keeping the knowledge fresh should download this app, it is amazing.

**Thoughts:** I needed a little rest from the pc since it has been nuts in the office lately, deploying a project where I'm a solo developer can be really exhausting, but i did enjoyed reviewing my knowledge.

### Day 8: July 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Today I spent some time on a website I'm working on, I took about an hour to pass the main sections of the site from a sketch to actual code and I feel comfortable with how it's looking but I might be revamping the color pallette a little bit and also work on animations, after I'm done with that I'll go on with the next sections.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoy creating a website from scratch, see how my websites come from a blank page to a full site it's quite an experience and I usually get satisfied by the final result, I also get better with each site so I just love doing this.

### Day 9: July 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I knew I was going to do this, I ended up revamping one of the sections ([Images on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheCodeRaccoons/status/1153843146603651077)) but in the end I think it ended up quite great so i guess I'll leave it as is right now.
2. On the office I worked a little with network validations, I don't usually count in what I do at work for this since... well I code about 10 hours daily there but Java is not what I want to focus during the #100DaysOfCode challenge, but I just have a hell of a time to actually manage to validate either if an internet connection is good enough to work online.

**Thoughts:** Just a frendly reminder to my self, stay away of enterprise projects that involve a mobile app that works online - offline and "Have to" be updated in "Real time" gosh i sometimes think about why I thought it would be easy xD.
