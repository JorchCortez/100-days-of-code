# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 7, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I'm re starting with my MERN Full stack development course today and just about to push some changes to an api im working on for a D&D related app, I will probably share a photo of how that is working today on twitter.

2. I worked on a Game Development project I joined with some friends today, pulishing my character controller bc I wasn't comfortable with the way it was working, but I guess it is working better now, i might post something on twitter about the game in some point later this month.

**Thoughts:** I've tried my 100DaysOfCode Challenge a couple of times before last year and I got a little frustrated bc I've been unable to made it through the first month, that's why I've started again, as I said on Twitter new year, new try, new me  bc I really want to build a habit out of coding specially since it was one of my hobbies before I started working but lately I've been overwhelmed by my full time job since even when I get to try new things every now and then i just feel like I'm not learning anything I really am interested in so, let's hope this can make my love for programming come back again bc i really miss it!
