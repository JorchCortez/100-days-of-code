# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Worked on a couple of excercises on Free code camp's Front End Libraries Certification.
2. Started a landing site for a small job I have.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since last time I used bootstrap and to be honest I thought I have forgotten most of it but during the exercises I did I noteced that I still remember quite a lot about it, I also remembered why I started creating my own css for my sites, not that I dislike bootstrap but i guess everything seemed like anything else on the internet so I'm building the css of the project I'm working on from scratch and see how it goes.
