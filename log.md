# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Worked with my website's blog markdown, added the markdown to show bold text.
2. Created my last project to get the Responsive Web Design certification from Free code camp.

**Thoughts:** I've worked with HTML and CSS for quite a while now, even though I usually searched for the way to do things, how to fully center an object, create gradients, even using the media querys used to be a common search, but during the projects for this certificate I noticed i didn't opened a single site on how to do this or that, I just created the code on my own, man that makes me see my progress and now i just feel amazing on how much i learned during the past weeks that i was going through the course.
