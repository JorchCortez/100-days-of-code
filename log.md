# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I finished the 2nd module of the [react native practical guide](https://www.udemy.com/react-native-the-practical-guide) on Udemy, and started a couple of DB models for an app I'm building.

**Thoughts:** I've tried my 100DaysOfCode Challenge twice already and I'm a little frustrated bc I've been unable to made it through the first month, that's why I've started again, I really want to build a habit out of coding specially since it is one of my hobbies but lately I've been working like a maniac at the office and I really want to take a chance now that I've handled the project I was working on, so atm I'm really motivated so let's see how far can we go!.
