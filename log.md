# 100 Days Of Code - Log
I'll be adding my day to day log here mainly because I don't really use Twitter that much ðŸ˜… but will keep this file updated as much as possible 

## Day 1: January 19, 2022

### ðŸ“… Today's Progress:
Starting with a new project, a small crypto viewer to continue working with react and starting to work with GraphQL and Tailwind CSS ðŸ˜Ž.
Finally got approval for my first Chrome extension B) link in my Git Bio.

### ðŸ¤” Thoughts:
I've tried 100DaysOfCode Challenge a couple of times before without much success but this particular time after 2 years in a pandemic I guess it is worth giving it a try again, Let's do this and see how it goes :)

## Day 2: January 20, 2022

### ðŸ“… Today's Progress:
Didn't really did much today I was mainly trying to fix some things with an old project (as usual had some dependencies which were already outdated and everything is breaking (: )

### ðŸ¤” Thoughts:
I will start with a couple of new apps one of them being a new project I decided to create and I'm feeling quite happy about it :)

## Day 3: January 21, 2022

### ðŸ“… Today's Progress:
Just as I said yesterday today I started with one of the projects (though the start has only been the "create the project setup" ) I will be working on the design along with a quick refresher for React since it's been about 6 months since I used it for the last time and I want to get proficient with hooks :3 but that'll be something I'll be doing along

### ðŸ¤” Thoughts:
I believe with this project I might take most of the 100 days of code since it seems a bit big but I guess we'll see ðŸ˜Ž

## Day 5: January 23, 2022

### ðŸ“… Today's Progress:
Started React TCG course's project #1 and made a quick code cleanup on an old project I had

### ðŸ¤” Thoughts:
Might take a bit to go through it but just because the course is a bit slow and I don't have a lot of time through the day

## Day 6: January 24, 2022

### ðŸ“… Today's Progress:
Continued with React TCG Course today, got to about 1/3 of the first project, changing most of the look of the app since I don't really like the appearance but keeping the core elements of it.

### ðŸ¤” Thoughts:
Thinking about the core for my next App might go for Next Js for the core app what to do what to dooo

## Day 7: January 25, 2022

### ðŸ“… Today's Progress:
- Successfully updated Rust-420 project's parallax background from a SCSS funtion to fully CSS, worked with css's 3D properties which is new for me so it was fun to work on.
- Started work on site updates for Rust 420
- Finished first sectiion of the React TCG course, meaning first part of the first app and code cleanup have been made.

### ðŸ¤” Thoughts:
Remembering about React is actually quite simple, I have already got a hang of it and now I'm only going as fast as the course goes but overall I'm having fun working on this again. Also excited about the work in the new app I'm planning but I'll be working on the Texas-420 website first since I will reuse some of it's functionalities later on :D

### ðŸ“… Today's Progress:
- Worked with Docker... properly for the first time.
- Continued my progress on the React TCG course, not a lot done today but I was working with hooks wor some time 

### ðŸ¤” Thoughts:
Tough day today, I was biting a bit more than I could chew at work which got me pretty tired and not supper eager to working at night, though I managed to grab some energy from god knows where I still feel a bit tired, I'm sure tomorrow I'll be able to work better on my stuff after work :D
