# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Worked on a couple of excercises on Free code camp's Front End Libraries Certification.
2. Started a landing site for a small job I have.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since last time I used bootstrap and to be honest I thought I have forgotten most of it but during the exercises I did I noteced that I still remember quite a lot about it, I also remembered why I started creating my own css for my sites, not that I dislike bootstrap but i guess everything seemed like anything else on the internet so I'm building the css of the project I'm working on from scratch and see how it goes.

### Day 2: July 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I keept working on my Free code camp's Front End Libraries Certification, currently on the jQuery section, I wan't to start with the react section so bad!
2. I will keep some progress on the landing I've started yesterday, even though I haven't done anything today.

**Thoughts:** After finishing the bootstrap module I was so nostalgic, bootstrap was one of the first frameworks I've worked with and using it again after around 2 years has been nice, there's a lot of new things going on, might give it a try on the folowing days but I do feel really comfortable writting my own CSS code now a days. Working with some jQuery now and even when I use it on my daily bases I know I still have much to learn.

### Day 3: July 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Worked today with the SASS module on Free code camp's Front End Libraries Certification, just finished it and started right away with the react module, I'm just a few exercises into it but I'm having lots of fun, also the SASS module was cool as well, I guess I'll go for Javascript30 as soon as I finish this cert. let's see how it goes.
2. The landing, I'm actually working on some ideas for the about section, (Link below)

**Thoughts:** For the past 2 or 3 years I've been using SCSS on my web apps, I'm still figuring out what I can use all the diferent functions on SASS for but i guess I'll do a project one of this days in order to play around with them.

**Today's Progress**: 
1. Worked today with the react module of Free code camp's Front End Libraries Certification, only did a couple execises but it was fun

**Thoughts:** I have made a couple of web apps on react and I do feel confortable working with it but I can notice there is way more things and I want to learn it all!

### Day 5: July 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I wanted to keep up with Free code camp's Front End Libraries Certification but i had just a lot of things to do at work, I ended up fixing some code I wrote way back at the begining of the project somewhere around 2 years ago so I do feel great about it.

**Thoughts:** After 4 years of working with native Android development and 2 years with my current project I feel nice to see how much I've grown on my coding skills, I guess I might look for a koltin course since I have this feeling koltin will replace java eventually, but we'll see.

### Day 6: July 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I continued with my Free code camp's Front End Libraries Certification's react module and did a couple of exercises.
2. Took pen and paper and worked on some simple design ideas for a website Im working on, might post some images of the pens tomorrow as I make them.


**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I took pen and paper to actually draw a layaut, im not really used to it but i guess ill do it more often, i felt great the fact that I could literally draw what ever came to my mind.
